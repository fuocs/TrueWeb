\section{Solution}
To address the aforementioned limitations, this project proposes \textbf{TrueWeb}, a lightweight desktop application designed to evaluate the safety of websites before user access. TrueWeb aims to analyze both technical safety and content safety by collecting and processing various types of website information, including protocol security, SSL certificate validity, domain age, domain patterns, and website reputation. In addition, the system integrates AI-based analysis to detect phishing-related content and provide recommendations for safer alternative websites when potential risks are identified.
