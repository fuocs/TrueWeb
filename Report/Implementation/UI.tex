\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Asynchronous Loading:} Heavy operations such as screenshot generation and API calls are performed in background threads to prevent UI freezing.
    \item \textbf{Progressive Rendering:} Analysis results are displayed progressively as individual modules complete, rather than waiting for all checks to finish.
    \item \textbf{Image Caching:} Screenshots and icons are cached locally to reduce redundant network requests.
    \item \textbf{Lazy Loading:} Detailed analysis information is loaded on-demand when users expand specific sections, reducing initial rendering time.
\end{itemize}

The user interface implementation successfully translates the system's technical capabilities into an accessible, visually appealing, and efficient user experience that caters to both novice and advanced users.
